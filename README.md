<br />Authenti-Snap<br />
## What does your app do?
Imagine capturing a screenshot, instantly recording the website it came from, and being able to lock it down as verifiable proof without any hassle. That's what Authenti-Snap does! It’s like having a notary for your screenshots. It's secure, accurate, and tamper-proof due to the encrypted hash that tracks the screenshot, date-time stamp, and website metadata. Everything is stored safely using Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for future integration with blockchain technologies. Whether it’s for documenting legal proof for a SOX audit, storing your diploma, or sharing paystubs, Authenti-Snap is the perfect web3 solution.
