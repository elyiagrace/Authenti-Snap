<br />Authenti-Snap<br />


<br /><br />Iimagine capturing a screenshot, instantly proving the website it came from, and being able to lock it down as verifiable proof without any hassle. That's what Authenti-Snap does! It’s like having a notary for your screenshots. The screenshot, date-time stamp, and website metadata are safely captured and stored using InterPlanetery File System for easy integration with blockchain technologies. It's secure, accurate, and tamper-proof. Whether it’s for sharing paystubs with your bank, preparing for a technology-risk audit, keeping compliance records, or proving intellectual property, Authenti-Snap is the perfect web3 solution.
